The ACF and PACF suggested that AR and MA could be 0, 1, or 2.  All models checked seemed to pass the diagnostic plots so I moved to AIC and BIC coefficients. The best model was $(0,1,1)(0,1,1)_{12}$.  After checking that this model was less than 1.96 z-score I went to forecasting.  In forecasting the data all, but a single point fall within the prediction intervals.  With a 95% prediction interval we would expect some points to fall outside the interval.
